## Iterator Pattern 
The basic idea of an Iterator is to provide a way to access the elements of some *aggregated* object 
(some data structure). 

Accessing element from a data structure sounds very simple when you think of an array or linked list,
but it gets complicated when you think of more complex data structures like tree or a graph 
which can have more than one way to traverse depending on the output required.
